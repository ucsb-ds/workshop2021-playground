# workshop2021-playground
Welcome!

This is a testing repo for the [UCSB Data Science Capstone Preparation Workshop](https://ucsb-ds.github.io/workshop2021).
It was created as part of the [Warm-up activity](https://ucsb-ds.github.io/workshop2021/intro-git#warm-up).

We encourage you to add your information below -- GitHub uses a formatting language called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started), which you can practice by following the 7 steps of this tutorial: <https://www.markdowntutorial.com>.

# Interactive activity

In order to see how the Pull Requests (PR) interact with the repo files and how to keep your fork up-to-date with the `PROJECT_REPO`, we recommend the following:
1. Assuming your group has 3+ people in it, have the first 2 participants fork this repo. The others should wait to do so until the PRs have been merged (to get the updated files).
1. Each participant modifies this README.md file by replacing the TODO line and adding their name to the bullet point in the respective section below.
1. Each participant submits a PR using GitHub, asking for their change to be incorporated.
1. One of the Maintainters accepts/merges the PR: the change should cause a merge conflict, since the bullet point contents in the `PROJECT_REPO` and `PROJECT_FORK` are different.
    * In this case (in an open-source collaboration model), the Maintainer is responsible for resolving the merge conflict.
    * Alternatively, the Maintainers usually review the PR and request the person who submitted the PR to fix the conflict.
    * If/when you are working on a project where everyone works on different branches, then committing changes to the `main` branch and merging its contents into your own branch is effectively what we are doing here, except that we delegate the decisions of what needs to be in the `main` branch to the Maintainer, and the "main branch" is effectively the `PROJECT_REPO`.
1. After the first PR has been merged, the other participants should see that their forked repo now has a note about being "behind" the original `PROJECT_REPO`: this means that the `PROJECT_REPO` now has the changes that their repos do not yet have.
    * The participants can issue a PR **from their fork** in order to merge these changes back into their forked repo.
    * The person whose PR was first merged, does not need to do anything until another PR merge causes their repo to "fall behind"
1. When the other participants go to fork the repo, they will get the updated repo, with the information from the PRs already in the `PROJECT_REPO`.

Now, having seen the above steps in action, the others can repeat the activity.
